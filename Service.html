                <h2>Aggie FLASH</h2>
                <h3>The first way I give back to the TAMU community is through my FLO (freshman leadership organization) where I am currently the finance executive. I've been in this organization for three years and have had the opportunity to grow as a person and help others grow as well. I've been able to experience so many new relationships with people I would have never met if it weren't for this organization. People I now call my best friends are what I got from this amazing organization, and I have the opportunity to pour into them and understand more about them and myself through this. It is something I am extremely passionate about and would do it over 1000x again if I could.</h3>

                <h2>Big Event</h2>
                <h3>I also give back to the community around me through the largest service event held by college students: Big Event. Big Event is a service event where people around the community sign up for the college students to come and help them around anything they need. Whether it is pulling weeds, organizing a garage, or laying out mulch. As volunteers we try and do anything we can to help them around the house because they go through enough being in a college town. Ultimately, we will do what they need as an appreciation for them and all they do.</h3>

                <h2>Twin City Mission</h2>
                <h3>Twin City Mission is the philanthropy for which my org does all of its service events for. It is an organization that raises money and holds things like soup kitchens for those in the Bryan-College Station area. Further, we host an annual 5k color run called FLASH Dash and raise money for the philanthropy and anyone can attend! Finally, through soup kitchens and thrift shops everyone in FLASH contributes to the amazing work that Twin City Mission does. </h3>
